Lightweight Alternative to RJW and NL's Facial Animations For Maximum Compatibility

[-=! DISCLAIMER !=-]

This mod adds (toggle-able) EXPLICIT features to RimWorld. FOR ADULTS ONLY!
This mod does NOT include grape, or beast stuff!

Unsubbing and resubbing will not always update the mod, use RimSort to update if anything is broken, or you're missing a feature after attempting to resub!

[-= ABOUT =-]

A lightweight, bare-bones, alternative to RJW and NAL's facial animations. Built for maximum compatibility. Best used alongside Intimacy, but can work standalone.

[-= FEATURE SUMMARY =-]

- Manual interactions (A lot like manual lovin', can be turned off in favor of other systems)
- Karma system (Optional, select a hero and gain perks, and debuffs)
- Lovin' animations (explicit, can be turned off in favor of RJW)
- Facial animations (turn this off if you want to use NAL's instead)

[-= INTEGRATIONS =-]

[ Turkler's Intimacy Mod Integration ]

- Plays a random animation when lovin'
- Lovin' checks now use Intimacy's if mod is installed

[ NL Facial Animations ]

- NL's faces now animate during manual lovin' from my mod if used in favor over my facial animations

[-= WIP from first to last =-]

1. Reworking the textures for faces and making them customizable and unique to each pawn
2. Tuning the karma system for ideology instead of it being black and white
3. "Service" houses
4. In-game animation creator
5. More mod integrations

[-= GUIDE =-]

[ Karma ]

Set a hero to be responsible for your "deeds" good OR bad

You do NOT need to set a hero for the other features to work, this is only for if you like to make self-inserts, and want some balanced perks to go along with your play-style.

[ Facial expressions / Animations ]

You can turn facial animations off in favor of NL's facial animations, or default vanilla.
The lovin' animation system and assets are a reworked and updated version of "c0ffeeee's rimworld animation framework".

[ Interactions ]

In the interaction float menu after right-clicking a pawn, you will have a new "Interactions" option.
You will be allowed to interact with colonists manually this way, chat, insult, marry, etc.
The following conditions must apply to engage in explicit lovin' (if Intimacy isn't installed):

- in a relationship (this will remove the need of some conditions to be true)
- romantically compatible (this takes into account orientation, compatibility, and opinion)
- both are adults
- both are not drafted

You can turn on debug mode in the settings to ignore some of these restrictions for testing.
Otherwise, (if Intimacy installed), Intimacy's rules are followed
